Howdy. I'm Matthew Re.

I currently teach at Clemson University, where I am a lecturer in the School of Computing's computer science department.

I completed my bachelor's Degree in computer science in 2021 at The University of South Carolina in Columbia. After graduation, I began a Ph.D. at Clemson University in the Human-Centered Computing department, with a research focus on accessibility for neurodiverse (namely ADHD and Autism) individuals in CS education. However, after two years in the Ph.D. program, I decided to graduate early with my Masters in Computer Science to pursue full-time teaching at the collegiate level, bringing me to where I am today.
